# accessibility

---

I wanted to learn more about accessibility. This website followed a tutorial from a [Brad Traversy tutorial]([https://www.youtube.com/brad-traversy/](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MO4vEAu3hKE&t=47s). I will probably combine this tool with some others to make sure everything checks out before I publish a site.

### Features

- Takes in a url. Needs to include https:// or http://
- Compares the rendered page against accessibility rules. 
- Identifies the problem and provides suggestions needed to make the page compliant.
